## Info
This project was built for a presentation during the VueJS Dallas meetup on February 19, 2019. I wanted to build a small project that demonstrated the transition component in a somewhat realistic way.  As is typical for me, it grew into a bit more than that. This project now has examples of many different techniques that relate to the transition component; and a few things that don't. Hopefully it will prove useful.
